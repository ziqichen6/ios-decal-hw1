//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?
    
//: No, the values passed in to the init function are wrapped optionals, but in the word class, wordA and wordB are already declared to be forcefully unwrapped optionals. self.wordA and self.wordB in the Words class was already declared as an unwrapped optional, so when the init function sets the values of self.wordA and self.wordB, they will unwrapp the optionals fed into the function.


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    class func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for var i = 0; i < numElements; i++ {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: The compiler doesn't like the for loop because i is declared as a let, which is immutable and later it tries to increment i, so there is a problem. Instead, i should be declared as a var. This funtion also does not return true at the end, so if the word is a palindrome, the function exits with the wrong return type. In addition, arePalindrome is referenced in a class context, and before, it was an instance function, so you could only call it on an instance and not a class. Therefore, I had to fix it to be a class function.


//: ## Q3: More Functions and Object Initialization
    func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters : [Character : Int] = [Character: Int]() //Line X
        let lenA = self.wordA.characters.count
        let lenB = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] { //Line Y
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (letter, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: in Line X, we do not initialize the dictionary countLetters, and then we immediately use it in Line Y, I fixed it so that we initialize countLetters in Line X. IsAnagram is also called on an instance variable, and before it was defined as a class function, so it was giving an error. I had to change it so that it is an instance method by deleting class.
